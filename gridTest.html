                This map is an ongoing effort to pin over 800 lynchings and attempted lynchings in Alabama from 1865 to 1981. 
                The highlighted counties are ones whose victims have been extensively researched. 
                The Alabama Memory Project researches a new county each semester.

                <h2>Lynching In Alabama</h2>
                <p>
                The Black men, women, and children who were lynched died twice to history.  First, when their lives were taken by lynch mobs; and again, when history failed to record  their story. 
                    There are over 800 documented cases of racial terror lynchings in the state of Alabama. We hope that by sharing their names and their stories, this project will provide a measure of justice and a different memory of the past.
                    This project is an ongoing effort. We identify more lynchings and attempted lynchings and expand our methods every semester. You may navigate to a specific victimâ€™s case via the map or search bar below.
